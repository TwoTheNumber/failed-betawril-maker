i was trying to make a betawril (but every time a word repeats it loops) maker with python but i dont know how to code so i used chatgpt to do it, i did 9 prototypes but they all failed.


*Betawril

this is a type of editing where if a word is said that has been use before it its goes back to that, not to confused with betawrigtifu which is short for "but every time a word repeats it loops to its first use" where its basically the other one but... do i need to explain it? also i have released all 9 prototypes here, where you add the video, specify where it exports, and add an transcript, then whisper transcribes it and detects repeated words (and it fails) and some of them literally dont work at all... 
# Required dependencies:
#   - openai-whisper (for speech-to-text with word timestamps)
#   - moviepy (for video processing)
#   - tkinter (for GUI, usually included with Python)
#   - difflib (built-in, for fuzzy matching words)
# To install missing packages:
# pip install openai-whisper moviepy
and thats it, if you try to fix this and make it work using this as sort of an template credit me somehow
